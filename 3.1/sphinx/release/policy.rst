Zato life-cycle policy
======================

`Zato Source <https://zato.io>`_ offers a predictable release model designed to ensure both frequent delivery of new functionality
as well as minimization of change between major releases.

Each major Zato release is published at the end of June, each year. June was chosen to ensure that Zato is compatible with
latest LTS April Ubuntu releases.

Each major release receives 1 year of free support and at least 3 year of `commercial support <https://zato.io/support.html>`.
