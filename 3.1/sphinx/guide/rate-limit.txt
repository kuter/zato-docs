IP rate-limiting and white-listing
==================================

Overview
--------

IP rate-limiting and white-listing let one restrict access to Zato objects based on two sets of conditions:

* How many times in a given time a particular object is accessed (rate-limiting)
* Where incoming requests come from (white-listing)

It is possible to express rules of varying , such as the simple one below:

* This service can be used at most 1,000 times a day

Or a more intricate one:

* This user may use the system at most 10,000 times a day

  * But only from such and such IP ranges

* The person's API credentials should be included in the limit too

  * But they have their own additional limit - at most 50 times an hour
  * Unless the requests are being made from localhost in which case the limit is 200 times a minute

Building blocks
---------------

Rate-limiting definitions can be attached to objects, each of which may possibly have a parent object whose definition
may be checked too:
